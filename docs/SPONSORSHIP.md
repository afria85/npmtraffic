# Sponsorship

npmtraffic is intentionally **ad-free** and focuses on deterministic, audit-grade analytics.

Sponsorship (or one-time donations) helps fund:

- Hosting & bandwidth
- Monitoring + cache reliability
- Maintenance / bug fixes
- UX polish and analysis features

## Suggested tiers (example)

- **Backer (small monthly)**: helps fund monitoring and steady releases.
- **Supporter (mid)**: funds reliability improvements and response time on issues.
- **Sponsor (higher)**: funds roadmap items (charts, snapshots/history, export polishing).

Core features stay free. Sponsors pay for sustainability and reliability, not paywalls.
