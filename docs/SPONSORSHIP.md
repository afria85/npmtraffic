# Sponsorship

npmtraffic is free and ad-free. Sponsorship funds infrastructure and sustainable maintenance so the project can stay reliable.

## Where to sponsor

- GitHub Sponsors: `https://github.com/sponsors/afria85`

## What sponsorship supports

- Hosting & bandwidth
- Caching reliability and monitoring
- Maintenance, bug fixes, and UX improvements

## Principles

- Core features stay free.
- Sponsorship is optional; issues and feedback are welcome regardless.
- If funding meaningfully exceeds basic maintenance needs, it is directed toward roadmap items that improve trust and analysis depth.
