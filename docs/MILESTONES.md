# npmtraffic milestones

This document is intentionally lightweight. Treat it as a product-facing roadmap rather than an engineering backlog.

## Product milestones

### v0.2.x (stability + UX)
- Theme toggle works (system default + persisted override)
- Compare table alignment + clear column labels
- Dropdown reliability (range, export) with SSR safety
- Readable light theme (no low-contrast text)

### v0.3.x (trust + polish)
- Export UI unified (CSV / Excel CSV / JSON)
- Improved tooltips and copy (share-of-total, delta definition)
- Donate + GitHub sponsor hooks (non-intrusive)

### v0.4.x (analysis)
- Minimal line charts (single + compare) with tooltip (UTC date, downloads, delta, cache/stale)
- Optional MA7 toggle + event overlay markers

## Sponsorship goals (example)

These are optional and purely communicative—adjust to your comfort.

- **$250/mo**: cover hosting + monitoring, keep site ad-free.
- **$500/mo**: reduce maintenance lag; faster issue turnaround.
- **$1000/mo**: consistent roadmap delivery (charts, history, UX polish) and fewer part-time hours.
